# 22CGroupProject
This is a group project for my CIS 22C (Data Structures) class.
The point of this program is to create a rock database using a hash, bst, and a stack. The rock's name is the unique key and the type is the secondary key. The program allows you to insert, delete/undo-delete, and search by primary and secondary key.

Data:
	Rock: name, type, cleavage, color, hardness, value.
